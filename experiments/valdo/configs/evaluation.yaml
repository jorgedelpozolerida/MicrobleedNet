# An optional integer to integer label map to apply to segmentations (ground truth and predictions)
# before computation evaluations. Can for instance be used to merge predicted classes. For instnace:
# evaluation_label_map:
#   0: 0  # background
#   1: 1  # tumour core  --> tumour
#   2: 1  # tumour edema --> tumour
evaluation_label_map: null  # not used, keep all classes as defined in the dataset label map

# Optional label mapping (integer to readable) to use when logging results in ClearML.
# Should be defined with respect to the output of the evaluation_label_map above if set.
label_names_mapping: null  # not used, keep all classes as defined in the dataset label map

# The name of the SegmentationToClassificationConverter class to use to convert segmentations to
# classifications. If null, the defualt is used (usually 'pixel_count')
segmentation_to_classification_converter: 'pixel_count'
segmentation_to_classification_converter_kwargs:
  # The class index to use as the positive class. If null or not specified, class 0 is used.
  negative_class_index: 0

  # A integer to integer mapping of how many pixels of that class integer should be present in a
  # segmentation map to be considered a positive classification. If null, the threshold is 1 for all
  # classes.
  num_pixels_thresholds: null
