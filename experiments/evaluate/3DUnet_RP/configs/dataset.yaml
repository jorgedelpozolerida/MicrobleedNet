# Metadata settings
metadata_task_id: null  # if the metadata file is to be fetched from a ClearML task.

# Image/MRI settings
# In image_specs, multiple entries can be defined, each with a glob statement and a sequence_spec
# if sequences are, for instance, stored 1 per file. See 'load_sequence_spec' below for the
# sequences that are actually used for training and their input order.
