# Defines a list of mri_dict transformation layers to apply to different splits of data.
# Each transform must be a layer implmeneted in crbr.augmentations.layers that can be applied in a
# MRIDictTransform (see crbr.augmentations.transformations).

# There are currently 4 levels of transforms supported which opperate consecutively:
# 1. MRI loading transforms: These are applied to the raw MRI data before any cropping or 
#    patching and are >not< TF compiled. This is to allow passing arbitrary values in the original 
#    mri_dict which may not be TF tensor convertible. Usually, the final transform in this list
#    should KeepOnlyMRIDictKeys layer which removes any items in the mri_dict not tf tensor 
#    convertible. Only use this level for quick CPU-bound/eager data format checks etc. 
#    Intensive data augmentation should be done in the whole_mri_transforms level instead which can 
#    be compiled and put, e.g., on a GPU.
# 2. Whole MRI transforms: These are applied to the output of the MRI loading transforms and are
#    TF compiled. Usually, applies at least padding, cropping and normalization, but may also
#    include image-level augmentations.
# 3. Patch transforms: These are applied to individual patches after they have been extracted from
#    the MRI data.
# 4. Batch transforms: These are applied to batches of patches after they have been extracted from
#    the MRI data.

# The top-level key 'splits' with sub-keys split identifiers, e.g., 'train', 'valid' used to 
# specify the transforms to apply to each split of data at level two.

# Under each split group, sub-keys defining groups of transform, currently in 
# ('mri_loading_transforms', 'whole_mri_transforms', 'patch_transforms', 'batch_transforms'). 
# A whole transform can be omitted by setting its value to null.

# Under each transform level is a list of transform layers to apply in that block. 
# Each transform layer is a dictionary with the following keys:
#   - name: The name of the transform layer to apply. Must be a layer implemented in
#           crbr.augmentations.layers.
#   - mri_keys: A list of keys in the mri_dict to apply the transform to. If None, applies to all
#               keys in the mri_dict.
#   - kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the transform layer.
