   abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting.

Methods The ALFA parent cohort baseline visit included full cognitive evaluation, lifestyle habits questionnaires, DNA extraction, and MRI. The nested ALFA+ study adds wet and imaging biomarkers for deeper phenotyping. Results A total of 2743 participants aged 45 to 74 years were included in the ALFA parent cohort. We show that this cohort, mostly composed of cognitively normal offspring of AD patients, is enriched for AD genetic risk factors. Discussion The ALFA project represents a valuable infrastructure that will leverage with different studies and trials to prevent AD. The longitudinal ALFA+ cohort will serve to untangle the natural history of the disease and to model the preclinical stages to develop successful trials.},

   abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to determine whether ethnic differences in diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition account for ethnic differences in incident cardiovascular disease. Background: Coronary heart disease risks are elevated in South Asians and are lower in African Caribbeans compared with Europeans. These ethnic differences map to lipid patterns and ectopic fat deposition. Methods: Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 2,049 Europeans, 1,517 South Asians, and 630 African Caribbeans from 1988 through 1991 (mean age: 52.4 ± 6.9 years). Fatal and nonfatal events were captured over a median 20.5-year follow-up. Subhazard ratios (SHR) were calculated using competing risks regression. Results: Baseline diabetes prevalence was more than 3 times greater in South Asians and African Caribbeans than in Europeans. South Asians were more and African Caribbeans were less centrally obese and dyslipidemic than Europeans. Compared with Europeans, coronary heart disease incidence was greater in South Asians and less in African Caribbeans. The age- and sex-adjusted South Asian versus European SHR was 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52 to 1.91, p < 0.001) and remained significant (1.45, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.64, p < 0.001) when adjusted for waist-to-hip ratio. The African Caribbean versus European age- and sex-adjusted SHR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.79, p < 0.001) remained significant when adjusted for high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.92, p = 0.008). Compared with Europeans, South Asians and African Caribbeans experienced more strokes (age- and sex-adjusted SHR: 1.45 [95% CI: 1.17 to 1.80, p = 0.001] and 1.50 [95% CI: 1.13 to 2.00, p = 0.005], respectively), and this differential was more marked in those with diabetes (age-adjusted SHR: 1.97 [95% CI: 1.16 to 3.35, p = 0.038 for interaction] and 2.21 [95% CI: 1.14 to 4.30, p = 0.019 for interaction]). Conclusions: Ethnic differences in measured metabolic risk factors did not explain differences in coronary heart disease incidence. The apparently greater association between diabetes and stroke risk in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with Europeans merits further study. © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small haemorrhages nearby blood vessels. They have been recognized as important diagnostic biomarkers for many cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. In current clinical routine, CMBs are manually labelled by radiologists but this procedure is laborious, time-consuming, and error prone. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method to detect CMBs from magnetic resonance (MR) images by exploiting the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared with previous methods that employed either low-level hand-crafted descriptors or 2D CNNs, our method can take full advantage of spatial contextual information in MR volumes to extract more representative high-level features for CMBs, and hence achieve a much better detection accuracy. To further improve the detection performance while reducing the computational cost, we propose a cascaded framework under 3D CNNs for the task of CMB detection. We first exploit a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) strategy to retrieve the candidates with high probabilities of being CMBs, and then apply a well-trained 3D CNN discrimination model to distinguish CMBs from hard mimics. Compared with traditional sliding window strategy, the proposed 3D FCN strategy can remove massive redundant computations and dramatically speed up the detection process. We constructed a large dataset with 320 volumetric MR scans and performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed method, which achieved a high sensitivity of 93.16% with an average number of 2.74 false positives per subject, outperforming previous methods using low-level descriptors or 2D CNNs by a significant margin. The proposed method, in principle, can be adapted to other biomarker detection tasks from volumetric medical data.},

   abstract = {Background and Objective: : Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) are important biomarkers of cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a common MRI sequence where CMB appear as small hypointense blobs. The prevalence of CMB in the population and in each scan is low, resulting in tedious and time-consuming visual assessment. Automated detection methods would be of value but are challenged by the CMB low prevalence, the presence of mimics such as blood vessels, and the difficulty to obtain sufficient ground truth for training and testing. In this paper, synthetic CMB (sCMB) generation using an analytical model is proposed for training and testing machine learning methods. The main aim is creating perfect synthetic ground truth as similar as reals, in high number, with a high diversity of shape, volume, intensity, and location to improve training of supervised methods. Method: : sCMB were modelled with a random Gaussian shape and added to healthy brain locations. We compared training on our synthetic data to standard augmentation techniques. We performed a validation experiment using sCMB and report result for whole brain detection using a 10-fold cross validation design with an ensemble of 10 neural networks. Results: : Performance was close to state of the art (~9 false positives per scan), when random forest was trained on synthetic only and tested on real lesion. Other experiments showed that top detection performance could be achieved when training on synthetic CMB only. Our dataset is made available, including a version with 37,000 synthetic lesions, that could be used for benchmarking and training. Conclusion: : Our proposed synthetic microbleeds model is a powerful data augmentation approach for CMB classification with and should be considered for training automated lesion detection system from MRI SWI.},

   abstract = {Background: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel disease, characterised pathologically by progressive deposition of amyloid β in the cerebrovascular wall. The Boston criteria are used worldwide for the in-vivo diagnosis of CAA but have not been updated since 2010, before the emergence of additional MRI markers. We report an international collaborative study aiming to update and externally validate the Boston diagnostic criteria across the full spectrum of clinical CAA presentations. Methods: In this multicentre, hospital-based, retrospective, MRI and neuropathology diagnostic accuracy study, we did a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological data available to sites participating in the International CAA Association to formulate updated Boston criteria and establish their diagnostic accuracy across different populations and clinical presentations. Ten North American and European academic medical centres identified patients aged 50 years and older with potential CAA-related clinical presentations (ie, spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes), available brain MRI, and histopathological assessment for CAA diagnosis. MRI scans were centrally rated at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) for haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic CAA markers, and brain tissue samples were rated by neuropathologists at the contributing sites. We derived the Boston criteria version 2.0 (v2.0) by selecting MRI features to optimise diagnostic specificity and sensitivity in a prespecified derivation cohort (Boston cases 1994–2012, n=159), then externally validated the criteria in a prespecified temporal validation cohort (Boston cases 2012–18, n=59) and a geographical validation cohort (non-Boston cases 2004–18; n=123), comparing accuracy of the new criteria to the currently used modified Boston criteria with histopathological assessment of CAA as the diagnostic standard. We also assessed performance of the v2.0 criteria in patients across all cohorts who had the diagnostic gold standard of brain autopsy. Findings: The study protocol was finalised on Jan 15, 2017, patient identification was completed on Dec 31, 2018, and imaging analyses were completed on Sept 30, 2019. Of 401 potentially eligible patients presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital, 218 were eligible to be included in the analysis; of 160 patient datasets from other centres, 123 were included. Using the derivation cohort, we derived provisional criteria for probable CAA requiring the presence of at least two strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesions (ie, intracerebral haemorrhages, cerebral microbleeds, or foci of cortical superficial siderosis) or at least one strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesion and at least one white matter characteristic (ie, severe visible perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale or white matter hyperintensities in a multispot pattern). The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria were 74·8% (95% CI 65·4–82·7) and 84·6% (71·9–93·1) in the derivation cohort, 92·5% (79·6–98·4) and 89·5% (66·9–98·7) in the temporal validation cohort, 80·2% (70·8–87·6) and 81·5% (61·9–93·7) in the geographical validation cohort, and 74·5% (65·4–82·4) and 95·0% (83·1–99·4) in all patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0·797 (0·732–0·861) in the derivation cohort, 0·910 (0·828–0·992) in the temporal validation cohort, 0·808 (0·724–0·893) in the geographical validation cohort, and 0·848 (0·794–0·901) in patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The v2.0 Boston criteria for probable CAA had superior accuracy to the current Boston criteria (sensitivity 64·5% [54·9–73·4]; specificity 95·0% [83·1–99·4]; AUC 0·798 [0·741–0854]; p=0·0005 for comparison of AUC) across all individuals who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. Interpretation: The Boston criteria v2.0 incorporate emerging MRI markers of CAA to enhance sensitivity without compromising their specificity in our cohorts of patients aged 50 years and older presenting with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes. Future studies will be needed to determine generalisability of the v.2.0 criteria across the full range of patients and clinical presentations.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating AI algorithms as “medical devices” to ensure patient safety. However, recent work has shown that the FDA approval process may be deficient. In this study, we evaluate the evidence supporting FDA-approved neuroalgorithms, the subset of machine learning algorithms with applications in the central nervous system (CNS), through a systematic review of the primary literature. Articles covering the 53 FDA-approved algorithms with applications in the CNS published in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Scopus between database inception and January 25, 2022 were queried. Initial searches identified 1505 studies, of which 92 articles met the criteria for extraction and inclusion. Studies were identified for 26 of the 53 neuroalgorithms, of which 10 algorithms had only a single peer-reviewed publication. Performance metrics were available for 15 algorithms, external validation studies were available for 24 algorithms, and studies exploring the use of algorithms in clinical practice were available for 7 algorithms. Papers studying the clinical utility of these algorithms focused on three domains: workflow efficiency, cost savings, and clinical outcomes. Our analysis suggests that there is a meaningful gap between the FDA approval of machine learning algorithms and their clinical utilization. There appears to be room for process improvement by implementation of the following recommendations: the provision of compelling evidence that algorithms perform as intended, mandating minimum sample sizes, reporting of a predefined set of performance metrics for all algorithms and clinical application of algorithms prior to widespread use. This work will serve as a baseline for future research into the ideal regulatory framework for AI applications worldwide.},

   abstract = {Background: Transfer learning (TL) with convolutional neural networks aims to improve performances on a new task by leveraging the knowledge of similar tasks learned in advance. It has made a major contribution to medical image analysis as it overcomes the data scarcity problem as well as it saves time and hardware resources. However, transfer learning has been arbitrarily configured in the majority of studies. This review paper attempts to provide guidance for selecting a model and TL approaches for the medical image classification task. Methods: 425 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, published in English, up until December 31, 2020. Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers, with the aid of a third reviewer in the case of discrepancies. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for the paper selection and 121 studies were regarded as eligible for the scope of this review. We investigated articles focused on selecting backbone models and TL approaches including feature extractor, feature extractor hybrid, fine-tuning and fine-tuning from scratch. Results: The majority of studies (n = 57) empirically evaluated multiple models followed by deep models (n = 33) and shallow (n = 24) models. Inception, one of the deep models, was the most employed in literature (n = 26). With respect to the TL, the majority of studies (n = 46) empirically benchmarked multiple approaches to identify the optimal configuration. The rest of the studies applied only a single approach for which feature extractor (n = 38) and fine-tuning from scratch (n = 27) were the two most favored approaches. Only a few studies applied feature extractor hybrid (n = 7) and fine-tuning (n = 3) with pretrained models. Conclusion: The investigated studies demonstrated the efficacy of transfer learning despite the data scarcity. We encourage data scientists and practitioners to use deep models (e.g. ResNet or Inception) as feature extractors, which can save computational costs and time without degrading the predictive power.},

(b) RoI Transformer + learns oriented proposal from horizontal RoI. It involvs RPN, RoI Alignment, and regression. (c) Our proposed oriented RPN generates high-quality proposals in a nearly cost-free manner. The number of parameters of oriented RPN is about 1/3000 of RoI Transformer + and 1/15 of rotated RPN. Abstract Current state-of-the-art two-stage detectors generate oriented proposals through time-consuming schemes. This diminishes the detectors' speed, thereby becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection systems. This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented detector with promising accuracy and efficiency. To be specific, in the first stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free manner. The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them. Without tricks, oriented R-CNN with ResNet50 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on two commonly-used datasets for oriented object detection including DOTA (75.87% mAP) and HRSC2016 (96.50% mAP), while having a speed of 15.1 FPS with the image size of 1024×1024 on a single RTX 2080Ti. We hope our work could inspire rethinking the design of oriented detectors and serve as a baseline for oriented object detection. Code is available at https: //github.com/jbwang1997/OBBDetection.},

   abstract = {Object detection in aerial images is an active yet challenging task in computer vision because of the bird's-eye view perspective, the highly complex backgrounds, and the variant appearances of objects. Especially when detecting densely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the Region of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment between the final object classification confidence and local-ization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to address these problems. The core idea of RoI Transformer is to apply spatial transformations on RoIs and learn the transformation parameters under the supervision of oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations. RoI Transformer is with lightweight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object detection. Simply apply the RoI Transformer to light-head RCNN has achieved state-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets, i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed.

   abstract = {Background: Since the Nun Study in which cerebrovascular lesions (CVLs) were closely associated with the presence and severity of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular lesions have been drawing attention in understanding the pathophysiology underlying AD patients, especially elderly AD cases. The present study was conducted to elucidate the relationship between the CVLs and vascular risk factors (VRFs) in elderly AD patients. Methods: The present study was based on 120 cases (41 men and 79 women) who were diagnosed as having probable AD cases according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Their mean age was 75.6 years. All subjects underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI, neuropsychological evaluation and laboratory tests including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and ApoE. Hypertension diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DL), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypotension were regarded as VRFs. The subjects were divided into two age groups: young-old group (YOG) consisting of 55 cases who were younger than 75 years and old-old group (OOG) consisting of 65 cases who were 75 years or older. Results: Seventeen cases (14.2%) had 1 VRF, 46 cases (38.3%) had 2 VRF2, 37 cases (30.8%) had 3 VRFs and 15 cases (12.5%) had 4 VRFs. 69 cases (57.5%) had APOE- 34. On MRI findings, only 10 cases (8.3%) showed brain atrophy without CVLs, 61 cases (50.8%) showed lacunar lesions, 46 cases (38.3%) showed leuko-araiosis in addition to the brain atrophy, and 3 cases (2.5%) were diagnosed as having a superficial siderosis. Forty-three cases (66.2%) showed lacunar lesions in OOG, whereas only 18 cases (32.7%) showed lacunar lesions in YOG. Thalamic lacunar lesions were detected in 18 cases (15.0%) and basal ganglionic lacunar lesions were seen in 64 cases (54.2%). Old microbleeds (OMBs) were detected in 13 of 51 (17.5%) cases with APOE- 34, whereas only 7 of 69 (10.1%) cases without APOE- 34 showed OMBs. More marked leuko-araiosis was observed in OOG and in YOG. Conclusions: As the severity of CVLs was associated with age number of VRF in our AD patients, VRFs may modify the pathophysiology and clinical presentation in elderly AD patients.},

   abstract = {Objective: To compare the frequency of microbleeds identified by susceptibility-weighted MRI (SWMRI) in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and normal controls, and correlate these findings with neuropsychological tests. Methods: Research ethics committee approval and patient written informed consents were obtained. One hundred eleven patients with mTBI without parenchymal hemorrhage on CT and conventional MRI received SWMRI as well as a digit span and continuous performance test. One hundred eleven healthy volunteers without history of traumatic brain injury were enrolled as the control group and received conventional MRI with additional SWMRI study. We analyzed the number and location of microbleeds in both groups. Results: Twenty-six patients with mTBI and 12 control subjects presented microbleeds on SWMRI (p 5 0.0197). Sixty microbleeds were found in 26 patients with mTBI and 15 microbleeds in 12 control subjects. The mTBI group showed notably more microbleeds in the cortex/subcortical region (52 microbleeds, 86.7%, vs 3 microbleeds, 20%; p , 0.0001). Conversely, the control group showed more microbleeds in the central brain (9 microbleeds, 60%, vs 3 microbleeds, 5%; p , 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in number of microbleeds in the cerebellum and brain-stem (p 5 0.2598 and p 5 0.4932, respectively). Patients with mTBI who had detected microbleeds had lower digit span scores than the patients with negative SWMRI findings (p 5 0.017). Conclusion: Presence of mTBI-related microbleeds showed a neuropsychological defect on short-term memory function, indicating that the presence of microbleeds could be a possible severity biomarker for mTBI. Addition of the SWMRI technique to the MRI protocol for patients with mTBI is recommended.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common neurologic condition, and more than 75% of TBIs are classified as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by definition of the American Congress of Rehabilitative Medicine. 1-4 The course of mTBI is usually self-limited, but some patients experience dysfunctions that persist for life, leading to disability in social interaction and daily activities. 5,6 To date, there is a lack of effective clinical, laboratory, or imaging markers as prognostic factors for patients with mTBI. Pathophysiology of various symptoms in patients with mTBI still remains poorly understood. CT is the primary imaging examination of mTBI, but nearly always reveals negative findings. Susceptibility-weighted MRI (SWMRI) techniques are particularly helpful in detecting para-magnetic blood products. 7-10 The 2 most common SWMRI techniques in use are susceptibility-weighted imaging and susceptibility-weighted angiography (SWAN), both of which have similar ability in the detection of cerebral microbleeds and are superior to traditional T2*-weighted gradient-recall echo. 11 SWMRI has shown greater accuracy in detecting traumatic-related injuries, such as diffuse axonal and vascular injuries, than CT and conventional MRI techniques.},

   abstract = {Background and Objectives Age-related cognitive impairment is driven by the complex interplay of neurovascular and neurodegenerative disease. There is a strong relationship between cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and the cognitive decline observed in conditions such as Alzheimer disease. However, in the early, preclinical phase of cognitive impairment, the extent to which CMBs and underlying CAA affect volumetric changes in the brain related to neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Methods We performed cross-sectional analyses from 3 large cohorts: The Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Epidemiology of Dementia in Singapore study (EDIS). We conducted a confirmatory analysis of 82 autopsied cases from the Brain Arterial Remodeling Study (BARS). We implemented multivariate regression analyses to study the association between 2 related markers of cerebrovascular disease-MRI-based CMBs and autopsy-based CAA-as independent variables and volumetric markers of neurodegeneration as dependent variables. NOMAS included mostly dementia-free participants age 55 years or older from northern Manhattan. ADNI included participants living in the United States age 55-90 years with a range of cognitive status. EDIS included community-based participants living in Singapore age 60 years and older with a range of cognitive status. BARS included postmortem pathologic samples. Results We included 2,657 participants with available MRI data and 82 autopsy cases from BARS. In a meta-analysis of NOMAS, ADNI, and EDIS, superficial CMBs were associated with larger gray matter (β = 4.49 ± 1.13, p = 0.04) and white matter (β = 4.72 ± 2.1, p = 0.03) volumes. The association between superficial CMBs and larger white matter volume was more evident in participants with 1 CMB (β = 5.17 ± 2.47, p = 0.04) than in those with ≥2 CMBs (β = 1.97 ± 3.41, p = 0.56). In BARS, CAA was associated with increased cortical thickness (β = 6.5 ± 2.3, p = 0.016) but not with increased brain weight (β = 1.54 ± 1.29, p = 0.26).},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose- Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are frequently detected in patients with stroke, especially those who experience intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the clinical significance of MBs in subjects without cerebrovascular disease is still unclear. We performed a prospective study to determine whether the presence of MBs provides useful prognostic information in healthy elderly individuals. Methods- We tracked 2102 subjects (mean age, 62.1 years) over a mean interval of 3.6 years after they voluntarily participated in the brain checkup system at the Shimane Institute of Health Science. An initial assessment was performed to document the presence of MBs and silent ischemic brain lesions and to map the location of the MBs. During the follow-up period, we obtained information about stroke events that occurred in each subject. Results- MBs were detected in 93 of the 2102 subjects (4.4%). Strokes occurred in 44 subjects (2.1%) during the follow-up period. They were significantly more common among subjects with MBs. Age and hypertension were independent risk factors for MBs. The presence of MBs was more strongly associated with a deep brain hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 50.2; 95% CI, 16.7 to 150.9) than ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% CI, 2.20 to 12.2). All hemorrhagic strokes occurred in deep brain regions, and they were associated with MBs located in the deep brain region. Conclusions- This longitudinal study demonstrated that the presence of MBs can be used to predict hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, even in healthy elderly individuals.

This study to prospectively evaluated the association between microbleeds, hematoma and perihematomal edema volume, and various clinical data, as well as patient outcome. Thirty-one patients with ICH and 31 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in our study. They were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of microbleeds detected by MRI. Serial clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were estimated three months after hemorrhage. The major location of microbleeds among patients with ICH was the basal ganglia. The volume of perihe-matomal edema was correlated with the initial hematoma volume on the first, fifth and seventh days after hemorrhage in patients with microbleeds. For patients without microbleeds, this correlation was also significant on the seventh day. Cerebral microbleeds in patients with ICH, especially in the basal ganglia region, represent micro-angiopathy, and are associated with leakage of blood and formation of perihemorrhage edema. Brain microbleeds found in patients with ICH warrant further investigation for evaluation of stroke risk.},

   abstract = {Despite advances in data augmentation and transfer learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) difficultly generalise to unseen domains. When segmenting brain scans, CNNs are highly sensitive to changes in resolution and contrast: even within the same MRI modality, performance can decrease across datasets. Here we introduce SynthSeg, the first segmentation CNN robust against changes in contrast and resolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative model conditioned on segmentations. Crucially, we adopt a domain randomisation strategy where we fully randomise the contrast and resolution of the synthetic training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can segment real scans from a wide range of target domains without retraining or fine-tuning, which enables straightforward analysis of huge amounts of heterogeneous clinical data. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations to be trained (no images), it can learn from labels obtained by automated methods on diverse populations (e.g., ageing and diseased), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,000 scans of six modalities (including CT) and ten resolutions, where it exhibits unparallelled generalisation compared with supervised CNNs, state-of-the-art domain adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of SynthSeg by applying it to cardiac MRI and CT scans.},

   abstract = {Anticoagulation is highly effective in preventing stroke due to atrial fibrillation, but numerous studies have demonstrated low utilization of anticoagulation for these patients. Assessment of clinicians' attitudes on this topic indicate that fear of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), rather than appreciation of anticoagulation benefits, largely drives clinical decision-making for treatment with anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Risk stratification strategies have been used for anticoagulation benefits and hemorrhage risk, but ICH is not specifically addressed in the commonly used hemorrhage risk stratification systems. Cerebral microbleeds are cerebral microscopic hemorrhages demonstrable by brain MRI, indicative of prior microhemorrhages, and predictive of future risk of ICH. Prevalence of cerebral microbleeds increases with age; and cross-sectional and limited prospective studies generally indicate that microbleeds confer substantial risk of ICH in patients treated with chronic anticoagulation. MRI thus is a readily available and appealing modality that can directly assess risk of future ICH in patients receiving anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Incorporation of MRI into routine practice is, however, fraught with difficulties, including the uncertain relationship between number and location of microbleeds and ICH risk, as well as cost-effectiveness of MRI. A proposed algorithm is provided, and relevant advantages and disadvantages are discussed. At present, MRI screening appears most appropriate for a subset of atrial fibrillation patients, such as those with intermediate stroke risk, and may provide reassurance for clinicians whose concerns for ICH tend to outweigh benefits of anticoagulation. © 2013 Fisher.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleed (CMB) based on magnetic resonance imaging has been recently investigated as key biomarker in the diagnosis of cerebral small-vessel diseases and vascular cognitive impairment. Because the CMB lesions are typically small in size, and easily confused with various analogs such as calcified deposits, artifacts, and especially blood vessels when they are observed from a single MRI slice, reducing false positives in CMB detection is quite challenging. In addition, the lack of available medical image data, which inevitably leads to the imbalance between positive and negative samples, is also a challenge to existing deep learning algorithms. To address these problems, this paper proposes a simple but effective CMB detection method based on a novel deep architecture. First, in contrast to the current local patches-based approach, we make full use of the information about the distribution of CMBs in the whole brain based on training data as priori knowledge to guide the model to obtain candidate CMB patches. Second, we propose a 2.5D convolutional neural network based on morphological differences in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral microbleeds. Specifically, we further use information of the candidates in the coronal and sagittal planes and combine the inference based on three planes to determine the CMB probability of each patch. This approach strikes a balance between the high computational cost and the loss of spatial information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results that show that our KBPNet model has a sensitivity of 98.24%, an accuracy of 94.10% and an average number of false positives per patient of 1.72 on the SWI-CMB dataset.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections. Methods: In our method, the first step consists of an initial candidate detection step that detects CMBs with high sensitivity. In the second step, candidate discrimination step is performed using a knowledge distillation framework, with a multi-tasking teacher network that guides the student network to classify CMB and non-CMB instances in an offline manner. Finally, a morphological clean-up step further reduces false positives using anatomical constraints. We used four datasets consisting of different modalities specified above, acquired using various protocols and with a variety of pathological and demographic characteristics. Results: On cross-validation within datasets, our method achieved a cluster-wise true positive rate (TPR) of over 90% with an average of <2 false positives per subject. The knowledge distillation framework improves the cluster-wise TPR of the student model by 15%. Our method is flexible in terms of the input modality and provides comparable cluster-wise TPR and better cluster-wise precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When evaluating across different datasets, our method showed good generalizability with a cluster-wise TPR >80 % with different modalities. The python implementation of the proposed method is openly available.},

Recent studies on COVID-19 have shown an increase in CMBs of coronavirus cases. Automatic detection of CMBs is challenging due to the small size and amount of CMBs making the classes highly imbalanced, lack of publicly available annotated data, and similarity with CMB mimics such as calcifications, irons, and veins. Hence, the existing deep learning methods are mostly trained on very limited research data and fail to generalize to unseen data with high variability and cannot be used in clinical setups. To this end, we propose an efficient 3D deep learning framework that is actively trained on multi-domain data. Two public datasets assigned for normal aging, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease analysis as well as an in-house dataset for COVID-19 assessment are used to train and evaluate the models. The obtained results show that the proposed method is robust to low-resolution images and achieves 78% recall and 80% precision on the entire test set with an average false positive of 1.6 per scan.},

Therefore, detecting CMBs can evaluate the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and use its presence to support CSVD classification, both are conducive to optimizing CSVD management. This study aimed to develop and test a deep learning (DL) model based on susceptibility-weighted MR sequence (SWS) to detect CMBs and classify CSVD to assist neurologists in optimizing CSVD management. Patients with arteriolosclerosis (aSVD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) treated at three centers were enrolled between January 2017 and May 2022 in this retrospective study. The SWSs of patients from two centers were used as the development set, and the SWSs of patients from the remaining center were used as the external test set. The DL model contains a Mask R-CNN for detecting CMBs and a multi-instance learning (MIL) network for classifying CSVD. The metrics for model performance included intersection over union (IoU), Dice score, recall, confusion matrices, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Results: A total of 364 SWS were recruited, including 336 in the development set and 28 in the external test set. IoU for the model was 0.523 ± 0.319, Dice score 0.627 ± 0.296, and recall 0.706 ± 0.365 for CMBs detection in the external test set. For CSVD classification, the model achieved a weighted-average AUC of 0.908 (95% CI 0.895–0.921), accuracy of 0.819 (95% CI 0.768–0.870), weighted-average precision of 0.864 (95% CI 0.831–0.897), and weighted-average F1-score of 0.829 (95% CI 0.782–0.876) in the external set, outperforming the performance of the neurologist group. Conclusion: The DL model based on SWS can detect CMBs and classify CSVD, thereby assisting neurologists in optimizing CSVD management.},

To aid in dealing with this finding and judging its clinical significance, this review addresses important aspects of a CMB, including the definition, prevalence, and incidence in various populations, end-organ damage, associated conditions, and whether any action or treatment by the clinician might be indicated. Methods: PubMed Medline, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Current Contents, and Derwent Drug Files databases were searched for the keywords “microbleeds-detection-damage”, “silent bleeds”, “microbleeds”, or “silent bleeds AND hemophilia” from 2011–2016. References of retrieved articles were also reviewed and included if applicable. Results: The published data are found primarily in the imaging literature and focus on diagnostic techniques. Some publications address relationships with diverse, co-existing clinical conditions and implications for treatment, especially in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and antithrombotic therapy. Conclusions: It is critical for non-radiologist clinicians (primary care, internists, neurologists, hematologists) to be aware of the potential importance of the finding of a CMB, and the fact that these lesions are not always truly silent or without important clinical consequences. As additional studies appear, clinicians may be able to “hear” more clearly through the silence of the CMB and understand potential clinical implications in patients.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small brain hemorrhages caused by the break down or structural abnormalities of small vessels of the brain. Owing to the paramagnetic properties of blood degradation products, CMBs can be detected in vivo using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). SWI can be used not only to detect iron changes and CMBs, but also to differentiate them from calcifications, both of which may be important MR-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, SWI can be used to quantify the iron in CMBs. SWI and gradient echo (GE) imaging are the two most common methods for the detection of iron deposition and CMBs. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the number of voxels detected in the presence of a CMB on GE magnitude, phase and SWI composite images as a function of resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), TE, field strength and susceptibility using in silico experiments. Susceptibility maps were used to quantify the bias in the effective susceptibility value and to determine the optimal TE for CMB quantification. We observed a non-linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the magnitude images, but a linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the phase and SWI composite images. The optimal TE values for CMB quantification were found to be 3 ms at 7 T, 7 ms at 3 T and 14 ms at 1.5 T for a CMB of one voxel in diameter with an SNR of 20: 1. The simulations of signal loss and detectability were used to generate theoretical formulae for predictions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on Boundary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision) and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show that the new evaluation metrics track boundary quality improvements that are generally overlooked by current Mask IoU-based evaluation metrics.

   abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

First, we review the basic concepts of attention mechanism and formulation. Second, we surveyed over 300 articles related to medical image segmentation, and divided them into two groups based on their attention mechanisms, non-Transformer attention and Transformer attention. In each group, we deeply analyze the attention mechanisms from three aspects based on the current literature work, i.e., the principle of the mechanism (what to use), implementation methods (how to use), and application tasks (where to use). We also thoroughly analyzed the advantages and limitations of their applications to different tasks. Finally, we summarize the current state of research and shortcomings in the field, and discuss the potential challenges in the future, including task specificity, robustness, standard evaluation, etc. We hope that this review can showcase the overall research context of traditional and Transformer attention methods, provide a clear reference for subsequent research, and inspire more advanced attention research, not only in medical image segmentation, but also in other image analysis scenarios.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Image segmentation in medical physics plays a vital role in image analysis to identify the affected tumour. The process of subdividing an image into its constituent parts that are homogeneous in feature is called Image segmentation, and this process concedes to extract some useful information. Numerous image segmentation techniques have been developed, and these techniques conquer different restrictions on conventional medical segmentation techniques. This paper presents a review of medical image segmentation techniques and statistical mechanics based on the novel method named as Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The beauty of LBM is to augment the computational speed in the process of medical image segmentation with an accuracy and specificity of more than 95% compared to traditional methods. As there is not much information on LBM in medical physics, it is intended to present a review of the research progress of LBM. OBJECTIVE: As there is no review paper on the research progress of the LB method, this paper presents a review with an objective to give some thought regarding the different segmentation for medical image and novel LB method to advance interest for future investigation and exploration in medical image segmentation. METHODS: This paper in attendance a short review of medical image segmentation techniques based on Thresholding, Region-based, Clustering, Edge detection, Model-based and the novel method Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). CONCLUSION: In this paper, we outlined various segmentation techniques applied to medical images, emphasize that none of these problem areas has been acceptably settled, and all of the algorithms depicted are available for broad improvement. Since LBM has the benefits of speed and adaptability of modelling to guarantee excellent image processing quality with a reasonable amount of computer resources, we predict that this method will become a new research hotspot in image processing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: If the diagnostic and prognostic significance of brain microbleeds (BMBs) are to be investigated and used for these purposes in clinical practice, observer variation in BMB assessment must be minimized. METHODS: Two doctors used a pilot rating scale to describe the number and distribution of BMBs (round, low-signal lesions, <10 mm diameter on gradient echo MRI) among 264 adults with stroke or TIA. They were blinded to clinical data and their counterpart's ratings. Disagreements were adjudicated by a third observer, who informed the development of a new Brain Observer MicroBleed Scale (BOMBS), which was tested in a separate cohort of 156 adults with stroke. RESULTS: In the pilot study, agreement about the presence of ĝ‰¥1 BMB in any location was moderate (κ0.44; 95% CI, 0.32-0.56), but agreement was worse in lobar locations (κ0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.58) than in deep (κ0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.76) or posterior fossa locations (κ0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.84). Using BOMBS, agreement about the presence of ĝ‰¥1 BMB improved in any location (κ0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.86) and in lobar locations (κ0.78; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97). CONCLUSION: Interrater reliability concerning the presence of BMBs was moderate to good, and could be improved with the use of the BOMBS rating scale, which takes into account the main sources of interrater disagreement identified by our pilot scale.

To address these questions, it is necessary to reliably measure their presence and distribution in the brain. We designed and systematically validated the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale (MARS). We measured intrarater and interrater agreement for presence, number, and anatomical distribution of microbleeds using MARS across different MRI sequences and levels of observer experience. METHODS: We studied a population of 301 unselected consecutive patients admitted to our stroke unit using 2 GRE T2*-weighted MRI sequences (echo time [TE] 40 and 26 ms). Two independent raters with different MRI rating expertise identified, counted, and anatomically categorized microbleeds. RESULTS: At TE = 40 ms, agreement for microbleed presence in any brain location was good to very good (intrarater κ = 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.93]; interrater κ = 0.68 [95% CI 0.58-0.78]). Good to very good agreement was reached for the presence of microbleeds in each anatomical region and in individual cerebral lobes. Intrarater and interrater reliability for the number of microbleeds was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.98 [95% CI 0.97-0.99] and ICC = 0.93 [0.91-0.94]). Very good interrater reliability was obtained at TE = 26 ms (κ = 0.87 [95% CI 0.61-1]) for definite microbleeds in any location. CONCLUSION: The Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale has good intrarater and interrater reliability for the presence of definite microbleeds in all brain locations when applied to different MRI sequences and levels of observer experience. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

They are encountered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy and hypertensive vasculopathy. Their prevalence is common in ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of CMBs and associated risk factors in the elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke. Results: Cerebral microbleeds were significantly associated with the presence of hypertension (in the subgroup of recurrent stroke) and with hypercholesterolemia. There was a significant association between the number of the microbleeds and severity of white matter lesions as a higher number of microbleeds related to more severe white matter lesions. The microbleeds were more prevalent in the group of patients using antithrombotics. Conclusion: Age, hypercholesterolemia, and the use of antithrombotics emerged as the most important associated risk factors for the presence of CMBs.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-: We previously reported on the high prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in community-dwelling people aged 60 years and older. Moreover, we found that their spatial distribution likely reflects differences in underlying etiology. We have since almost quadrupled the number of participants in our study and expanded it to include persons of 45 years and older. We examined the prevalence and determinants of microbleeds in this larger and younger cohort from the general population. METHODS-: In 3979 persons (mean age, 60.3 years), we performed brain MRI at 1.5T, including a sequence optimized for visualization of CMBs. Associations between APOE genotype, cardiovascular risk factors, and markers of cerebrovascular disease with the presence and location of CMBs were assessed by multiple logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and relevant confounders. RESULTS-: Microbleed prevalence gradually increased with age, from 6.5% in persons aged 45 to 50 years to 35.7% in participants of 80 years and older. Overall, 15.3% of all subjects had at least 1 CMB. Cardiovascular risk factors and presence of lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions were associated with microbleeds in a deep or infratentorial region, whereas APOE &epsiv;4 and diastolic blood pressure were related to microbleeds in a strictly lobar location. CONCLUSIONS-: Findings in this larger population are in line with our previous results and, more importantly, extend these to a younger age group. CMBs are already present at middle age, and prevalence rises strongly with increasing age. We confirmed that determinants of the presence of cerebral microbleeds differ according to their location in the brain. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds are thought to have potentially important clinical implications in dementia and stroke. However, the use of both T2∗and SWI MR imaging sequences for microbleed detection has complicated the cross-comparison of study results. We aimed to determine the impact of microbleed sequences on microbleed detection and associated clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from our memory clinic (n = 246; 53% female; mean age, 62) prospectively underwent 3T MR imaging, with conventional thick-section T2∗, thick-section SWI, and conventional thin-section SWI. Microbleeds were assessed separately on thick-section SWI, thin-section SWI, and T2∗by 3 raters, with varying neuroradiologic experience. Clinical and radiologic parameters from the dementia investigation were analyzed in association with the number of microbleeds in negative binomial regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence and number of microbleeds were higher on thick-/thin-section SWI (20/21%) compared with T2∗(17%). There was no difference in microbleed prevalence/number between thick- and thin-section SWI. Interrater agreement was excellent for all raters and sequences. Univariate comparisons of clinical parameters between patients with and without microbleeds yielded no difference across sequences. In the regression analysis, only minor differences in clinical associations with the number of microbleeds were noted across sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the increased detection of microbleeds, we recommend SWI as the sequence of choice in microbleed detection. Microbleeds and their association with clinical parameters are robust to the effects of varying MR imaging sequences, suggesting that comparison of results across studies is possible, despite differing microbleed sequences.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose-We investigated the sensitivity and reliability of MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) compared with routine MRI T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) for cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection. Methods-We used data from a prospective study of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n=9; mean age, 71±8.3) and healthy non-cerebral amyloid angiopathy controls (n=22; mean age, 68±6.3). Three raters (labeled 1, 2, and 3) independently interpreted the GRE and SWI sequences (using the phase-filtered magnitude image) blinded to clinical information. Results-In 9 cerebral amyloid angiopathy cases, the raters identified 1146 total CMBs on GRE and 1432 CMBs on SWI. In 22 healthy control subjects, the raters identified ≥1 CMBs in 6/22 on GRE (total 9 CMBs) and 5/22 on SWI (total 19 CMBs). Among cerebral amyloid angiopathy cases, the reliability between raters for CMB counts was good for SWI (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.87) but only moderate for GRE (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.52). In controls, agreement on the presence or absence of CMBs in controls was moderate to good on both SWI (κ coefficient ranged from 0.57 to 0.74 across the 3 combinations of rater pairs) and GRE (κ range, 0.31 to 0.70). A review of 114 hypointensities identified as possible CMBs indicated that increased detection and reliability on SWI was related to both increased contrast and higher resolution, allowing better discrimination of CMBs from the background and better anatomic differentiation from pial vessels. Conclusions-SWI confers greater reliability as well as greater sensitivity for CMB detection compared with GRE, and should be the preferred sequence for quantifying CMB counts. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are increasingly recognised neuroimaging findings in individuals with cerebrovascular disease and dementia, and in normal ageing. There has been substantial progress in the understanding of CMBs in recent years, particularly in the development of newer MRI methods for the detection of CMBs and the application of these techniques to population-based samples of elderly people. In this Review, we focus on these recent developments and their effects on two main questions: how CMBs are detected, and how CMBs should be interpreted. The number of CMBs detected depends on MRI characteristics, such as pulse sequence, sequence parameters, spatial resolution, magnetic field strength, and image post-processing, emphasising the importance of taking into account MRI technique in the interpretation of study results. Recent investigations with sensitive MRI techniques have indicated a high prevalence of CMBs in community-dwelling elderly people. We propose a procedural guide for identification of CMBs and suggest possible future approaches for elucidating the role of these common lesions as markers for, and contributors to, small-vessel brain disease. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) frequently have small areas of signal loss on gradient-echo T2*-weighted MR images, which have been suggested to represent remnants of previous microbleeds. Our aim was to provide histopathologic support for this assumption and to clarify whether the presence and location of microbleeds were associated with microangiopathy. METHODS: We performed MR imaging and correlative histopathologic examination in 11 formalin-fixed brains of patients who had died of an ICH (age range, 45-90 years). RESULTS: Focal areas of signal loss on MR images were noted in seven brains. They were seen in a corticosubcortical location in six brains, in the basal ganglia/thalami in five, and infratentorially in three specimens. Histopathologic examination showed focal hemosiderin de-position in 21 of 34 areas of MR signal loss. No other corresponding abnormalities were found; however, hemosiderin deposits were noted without MR signal changes in two brains. All specimens with MR foci of signal loss showed moderate to severe fibrohyalinosis, and there was additional evidence of amyloid angiopathy in two of those brains. CONCLUSION: Small areas of signal loss on gradient echo T2*-weighted images indicate previous extravasation of blood and are related to bleeding-prone microangiopathy of different origins.},

We investigated the effect of APOE genotype on CMBs in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired middle- and old-aged individuals enriched for APOE-ε4 genotype. Participants from ALFA (Alzheimer and Families) cohort were included and their magnetic resonance scans assessed (n = 564, 50% APOE-ε4 carriers). Quantitative magnetic resonance analyses included visual ratings, atrophy measures, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentations. The prevalence of CMBs was 17%, increased with age (p < 0.05), and followed an increasing trend paralleling APOE-ε4 dose. The number of CMBs was significantly higher in APOE-ε4 homozygotes compared to heterozygotes and non-carriers (p < 0.05). This association was driven by lobar CMBs (p < 0.05). CMBs co-localized with WMH (p < 0.05). No associations between CMBs and APOE-ε2, gray matter volumes, and cognitive performance were found. Our results suggest that cerebral vessels of APOE-ε4 homozygous are more fragile, especially in lobar locations. Co-occurrence of CMBs and WMH suggests that such changes localize in areas with increased vascular vulnerability.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), also referred to as microhemorrhages, appear on magnetic resonance (MR) images as hypointense foci notably at T2∗-weighted or susceptibility-weighted (SW) imaging. CMBs are detected with increasing frequency because of the more widespread use of high magnetic field strength and of newer dedicated MR imaging techniques such as three-dimensional gradient-echo T2∗-weighted and SW imaging. The imaging appearance of CMBs is mainly because of changes in local magnetic susceptibility and reflects the pathologic iron accumulation, most often in perivascular macrophages, because of vasculopathy. CMBs are depicted with a truepositive rate of 48%-89% at 1.5 T or 3.0 T and T2∗-weighted or SW imaging across a wide range of diseases. False-positive "mimics" of CMBs occur at a rate of 11%- 24% and include microdissections, microaneurysms, and microcalcifications; the latter can be differentiated by using phase images. Compared with postmortem histopathologic analysis, at least half of CMBs are missed with premortem clinical MR imaging. In general, CMB detection rate increases with field strength, with the use of threedimensional sequences, and with postprocessing methods that use local perturbations of the MR phase to enhance T2∗ contrast. Because of the more widespread availability of high-field-strength MR imaging systems and growing use of SW imaging, CMBs are increasingly recognized in normal aging, and are even more common in various disorders such as Alzheimer dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, stroke, and trauma. Rare causes include endocarditis, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts, leukoencephalopathy, and radiation therapy. The presence of CMBs in patients with stroke is increasingly recognized as a marker of worse outcome. Finally, guidelines for adjustment of anticoagulant therapy in patients with CMBs are under development.},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

In a radiological setting, objects commonly have high within-class appearance variability whilst sharing certain characteristics across different classes, making their distinction even more difficult. As an example, markers of cerebral small vessel disease, such as enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and lacunes, can be very varied in their appearance while exhibiting high inter-class similarity, making this task highly challenging for human raters. In this work, we investigate joint models of individual rater behaviour and multirater consensus in a deep learning setting, and apply it to a brain lesion object-detection task. Results show that jointly modelling both individual and consensus estimates leads to significant improvements in performance when compared to directly predicting consensus labels, while also allowing the characterization of human-rater consistency.},

However, there is currently no systematic review that summarizes all of these tools or provides pooled estimates of their performance. Methods: In this PROSPERO-registered, PRISMA compliant systematic review, we sought to compile and review all MEDLINE and EMBASE published studies that have developed and/or tested AI algorithms for ICH detection on non-contrast CT scans (NCCTs) or MRI scans and CMBs detection on MRI scans. Results: In total, 40 studies described AI algorithms for ICH detection in NCCTs/MRIs and 19 for CMBs detection in MRIs. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92.06%, 93.54%, and 93.46%, respectively, for ICH detection and 91.6%, 93.9%, and 92.7% for CMBs detection. Some of the challenges encountered in the development of these algorithms include the laborious work of creating large, labeled and balanced datasets, the volumetric nature of the imaging examinations, the fine tuning of the algorithms, and the reduction in false positives. Conclusions: Numerous AI-driven software tools have been developed over the last decade. On average, they are characterized by high performance and expert-level accuracy for the diagnosis of ICH and CMBs. As a result, implementing these tools in clinical practice may improve workflow and act as a failsafe for the detection of such lesions.

Its fast and robust object detection, segmentation, tracking, and classification of pathophysiological anatomical structures can support medical practitioners during routine clinical workflow. Thus, deep learning-based applications for diseases diagnosis will empower physicians and allow fast decision-making in clinical practice. Highlight: Deep learning can be more robust with various features for differentiating classes, provided the training set is large and diverse for analysis. However, sufficient medical images for training sets are not always available from medical institutions, which is one of the major limitations of deep learning in medical image analysis. This review article presents some solutions for this issue and discusses efforts needed to develop robust deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis applications for better clinical workflow in endoscopy, radiology, pathology, and dentistry.

   abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics. Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level, namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical image analysis use cases.},

   abstract = {The medical imaging literature has witnessed remarkable progress in high-performing segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks. Despite the new performance highs, the recent advanced segmentation models still require large, representative, and high quality annotated datasets. However, rarely do we have a perfect training dataset, particularly in the field of medical imaging, where data and annotations are both expensive to acquire. Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions. We hope this survey article increases the community awareness of the techniques that are available to handle imperfect medical image segmentation datasets.},

   abstract = {High-quality labels are often very scarce, whereas unlabeled data with inferred weak labels occurs more naturally. In many cases, these weak labels dictate the frequency of each respective class over a set of instances. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to learning from such weakly-labeled data, which we call count-based weakly-supervised learning. At the heart of our approach is the ability to compute the probability of exactly k out of n outputs being set to true. This computation is differentiable, exact, and efficient. Building upon the previous computation, we derive a count loss penalizing the model for deviations in its distribution from an arithmetic constraint defined over label counts. We evaluate our approach on three common weakly-supervised learning paradigms and observe that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across all three of the paradigms.},

   abstract = {This paper provides the first review to date which gathers, describes, and assesses, to the best of our knowledge, all available publications on automating cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection. It provides insights into the current state of the art and highlights the challenges and opportunities in this topic. By incorporating the best practices identified in this review, we established guidelines for the development of CMB detection systems. We are confident that these guidelines can serve as a foundation for further research. CMB detection is a crucial but challenging task that can be laborious for radiologists. With the increasing popularity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the ability to detect CMBs has improved, but there is still a need to automate this process to enhance its efficiency and accuracy. A high prevalence of CMBs is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, an increased risk of stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is alarming to note that strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and Diabetes mellitus have secured their position as the second, seventh, and ninth most common causes of death worldwide, respectively. Moreover, CMBs are sometimes found in association with other pathologies and indicate a range of pathological processes in the cerebral vessels. Thus, it is essential to enhance the quality of diagnostics to facilitate prompt identification and treatment of these potentially life-threatening conditions. In this paper, we aimed to systematize the existing knowledge and best practices in automatic CMB detection, from fundamental information about CMBs and MRI image data, through employed datasets and CMB detection and verification algorithms, to methods of result evaluation. This can serve as a starting point for future research and the development of a CMB detection system that is practically applicable in medicine, leading to enhanced patient treatment outcomes.},

Imaging remains the most promising method for in vivo studies of CSVD. To replace the subjective and laborious visual rating approaches, emerging studies have applied state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to extract imaging biomarkers of CSVD from MRI scans. We aimed to summarise published computer-aided methods for the examination of three imaging biomarkers of CSVD, namely cerebral microbleeds (CMB), dilated perivascular spaces (PVS), and lacunes of presumed vascular origin. Seventy classical image processing, classical machine learning, and deep learning studies were identified. Transfer learning and weak supervision techniques have been applied to accommodate the limitations in the training data. While good performance metrics were achieved in local datasets, there have not been generalisable pipelines validated in different research and/or clinical cohorts. Future studies could consider pooling data from multiple sources to increase data size and diversity, and evaluating performance using both image processing metrics and associations with clinical measures.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections. Methods: In our method, the first step consists of an initial candidate detection step that detects CMBs with high sensitivity. In the second step, candidate discrimination step is performed using a knowledge distillation framework, with a multi-tasking teacher network that guides the student network to classify CMB and non-CMB instances in an offline manner. Finally, a morphological clean-up step further reduces false positives using anatomical constraints. We used four datasets consisting of different modalities specified above, acquired using various protocols and with a variety of pathological and demographic characteristics. Results: On cross-validation within datasets, our method achieved a cluster-wise true positive rate (TPR) of over 90% with an average of <2 false positives per subject. The knowledge distillation framework improves the cluster-wise TPR of the student model by 15%. Our method is flexible in terms of the input modality and provides comparable cluster-wise TPR and better cluster-wise precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When evaluating across different datasets, our method showed good generalizability with a cluster-wise TPR >80 % with different modalities. The python implementation of the proposed method is openly available.},

The relevance of machine learning research can only be improved if we also employ empirical rigor that incorporates reproducibility guidelines, especially so in the medical imaging field. The Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference has made advancements in this direction by advocating open access, and recently also recommending authors to make their code public - both aspects being adopted by the majority of the conference submissions. This helps the reproducibility of the methods, however, there is currently little or no support for further evaluation of these supplementary material, making them vulnerable to poor quality, which affects the impact of the entire submission. We have evaluated all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between 2018 and 2022 using established, but slightly adjusted guidelines on reproducibility and the quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing repositories and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps traceability, but the quality of the repositories has not improved over the years, leaving room for improvement in every aspect of designing repositories. Merely 22% of all submissions contain a repository that were deemed repeatable using our evaluations. From the commonly encountered issues during the evaluations, we propose a set of guidelines for machine learning-related research for medical imaging applications, adjusted specifically for future submissions to MIDL.},

The current gold standard for detecting and rating cerebral microbleeds in a research context is visual inspection by trained raters, a process that is both time consuming and subject to poor reliability. We present here a novel method to automate microbleed detection on GRE and SWI images. We demonstrate in a community-based cohort of older adults that the method is highly sensitive (greater than 92% of all microbleeds accurately detected) across both modalities, with reasonable precision (fewer than 20 and 10 false positives per scan on GRE and SWI, respectively). We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to identify microbleeds over longitudinal scans with a higher level of sensitivity than visual ratings (50% of longitudinal microbleeds correctly labeled by the algorithm, while manual ratings was 30% or lower). Further, the algorithm identifies the anatomical localization of microbleeds based on brain atlases, and greatly reduces time spent completing visual ratings (43% reduction in visual rating time). Our automatic microbleed detection instrument is ideal for implementation in large-scale studies that include cross-sectional and longitudinal scanning, as well as being capable of performing well across multiple commonly used MRI modalities.},

The nomenclature and radiological phenotypes of CSVD were published in 2013 based on the unified position of the so-called Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. The disease is characterized by a diverse clinical and radiological picture. It is primarily responsible for stroke incidents, gait disturbances, depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia in the elderly. The CSVD contributes to about 20% of strokes, including 25% of ischemic strokes and 45% of dementias. Common causes of CSVD include arteriosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), genetic small vessel angiopathy, inflammation and immune-mediated small vessel diseases, and venous collagenosis. There is no causal treatment and management is mainly based on combating known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).},

Their number and location provide valuable information in the long-term prognosis of patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Accurate detection of CMBs is necessary for both research and clinical applications. CMBs appear as small hypointense lesions on susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). Their size and shape vary markedly in cases of TBI. Manual annotation of CMBs is a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task. Several studies addressed the detection of CMBs in other neuropathologies with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we developed and contrasted a classification (Patch-CNN) and two segmentation (Segmentation-CNN, U-Net) approaches for the detection of CMBs in TBI cases. The models were trained using 45 datasets, and the best models were chosen according to 16 validation sets. Finally, the models were evaluated on 10 TBI and healthy control cases, respectively. Our three models outperform the current status quo in the detection of traumatic CMBs, achieving higher sensitivity at low false positive (FP) counts. Furthermore, using a segmentation approach allows for better precision. The best model, the U-Net, achieves a detection rate of 90% at FP counts of 17.1 in TBI patients and 3.4 in healthy controls.},
